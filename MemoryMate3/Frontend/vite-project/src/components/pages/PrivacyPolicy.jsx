            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 dark:text-white">Our Commitment to Data Security</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
                MemoryMate uses **industry-standard encryption (AES-256)** for all data both in transit and at rest. We employ strict **role-based access** to ensure only authorized patients and linked caregivers can access relevant information, protecting sensitive patient and caregiver communication logs. **All systems undergo quarterly security audits to maintain compliance and proactively address vulnerabilities.**
            </p>
            
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 dark:text-white">What Data is Collected?</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 space-y-2 pl-4">
                <li>**Personal Identification:** Name, Email, and Role (Patient/Caregiver) for account management.</li>
                <li>**Biometric Data (Optional):** Encrypted models of faces and voices, used exclusively for real-time recognition. **Raw images/audio are never stored on our servers; only transient models are processed.**</li>
                <li>**Cognitive Logs:** Game scores, conversation summaries, and reminder compliance data to track progress. **This health information is anonymized for internal analysis unless viewed by a linked caregiver.**</li>
                <li>**Technical Data:** Device type, operating system, and anonymous usage statistics to help optimize application performance and accessibility features.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 dark:text-white">How is Your Data Used?</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
                Data is used **only to provide and improve the MemoryMate service.** This includes enhancing AI recognition accuracy, generating cognitive progress reports for caregivers, and ensuring the personalized delivery of memory prompts. We **never sell** or share health data with third parties for marketing purposes. **We retain data only as long as an account remains active, and all associated data is permanently deleted upon account closure.**
            </p>
            
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 dark:text-white">Patient Control and Consent</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
                Patients have full control over camera and microphone access. The real-time recognition features **require explicit consent** and can be deactivated at any time, instantly stopping the collection of biometric data. **Users can request a copy of all their stored data, or complete erasure of their biometric models, directly through the Patient Dashboard settings.**
